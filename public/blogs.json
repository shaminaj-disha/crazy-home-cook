    "question": "What are the differences between Authorization and Authentication?\r\n",
    "answer": "Authentication is a process to identify the users for providing the access to the system, while in Authorization process, person’s or user’s authorities are checked for accessing the resources. In authentication process, users or persons are verified but in Authorization, users or persons are validated. Authentication is done before the authorization process and Authorization is done after the authentication process. Authorization usually needs user’s login details. While Authorization needs user’s privilege or security levels. Authentication determines whether the person is user or not but Authorization determines what permission the user have.\r\n"

    "question": "Why are you using Firebase? What other options do you have to implement authentication??\r\n",
    "answer": "Google Firebase is a Google-backed application development software that enables developers to develop iOS, Android and Web apps. Firebase provides tools for tracking analytics, reporting and fixing app crashes, creating marketing and product experiment. Additionally, it helps in the easy storing and retrieval of dynamic content. If we decide to develop the application without any form of custom coding the backend, Firebase makes this easy. It provides a seamless way to integrate with Google analytics using which the user behavioral data can be acquired, and insightful information can be generated through it. Other than Firebase, we have some other options for authentication like Okta, Auth0, OneLogin, Microsoft Azure Active Directory etc.\r\n"
